                        Simba is the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, Scar's nephew, Nala's mate, and Kiara and Kion's father. After defeating Scar, Simba takes Mufasa's place as King of Pride Rock before marrying Nala and having Kiara and Kion with her. His name means "lion" in Swahili which is his species.

                        In The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, Simba is an overprotective parent of Kiara, and obtains a great hatred of the Outsiders, a group of lions whom he exiled due to their loyalty to Scar, specifically Scar's protege Kovu, before learning to let go of his hate, and accepting Kovu as his son in law.

                        In The Lion Guard, Simba fathers Kion, and initially refuses to accept Kion's decision to allow non-lion animals into the Lion Guard, but later accepts his proposal. Currently in the show, after a failed attempt on Simba's life, orchestrated by the spirit of Scar, Simba and Kion plot to defeat him once again and for all. As of Season 3, Scar's ghost has been defeated and his followers have become neutral under the rule of Jasiri, who becomes the new Outlands' leader. However, due to a facial wound caused by a snake bite during the battle, Kion journeys to find the Tree of Life, to get healed. Simba bids his son farewell on his trip. He later welcomes Kion home following his journey and accepts his love to Rani of the Night Pride.
